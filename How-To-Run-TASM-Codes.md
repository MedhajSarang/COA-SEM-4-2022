Below is the step by step process to run a code in TASM.

Step 1 : Open TASM

Step 2 : Type EDIT

Step 3 : Enter the entire code without any errors

Step 4 : Once the entire code is written go to file and choose "SAVE AS"

Step 5 : Name the file name as => filename.asm 

Note : Use the .asm extension to save the file

Step 6 : Now go to the main screen by clicking EXIT in the "FILE" section

Step 7 : Now type, TASM filename.asm

Step 8 : Check that there are no errors.

Step 9 : Now type, Tlink filename.obj
